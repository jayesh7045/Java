1. in the classc file we saw how we were calculating the factorial of all the numbers of the array.
2. So we saw that we are running a loop for the 10 elements, and then for all those 10 elements we are calculating the
value of the factorial.
3. But What if we only want the output for 8 elements only.
4. So we will need to manually write the 8 codes of line for that
5. So to overcome this problem we came up with the knowledge to use the ExecutorsService in java
6. ExecutorsService is used to achive multithreading in java
7. ThreadFactory is also one more way to start all the threads at once
8. In manually starting each thread, we are multiple times going to the cpu/os and this is a costly operation
9. Thread factory is the abundaned(many) of threads
