Wait vs join

Join is from thread CLass
Wait is not from thread class
wait comes from object class
In Java multithreading, both `wait()` and `join()` are methods used for synchronization and coordination between threads,
but they serve different purposes:

1. **wait() Method**:
   - The `wait()` method is a method defined in the `Object` class in Java.
   - It is used for inter-thread communication and synchronization.
   - When a thread calls `wait()` on an object, it releases the lock on that object and enters the waiting state
   until another thread notifies it using the `notify()` or `notifyAll()` method on the same object.
   - Typically, `wait()` is used within a synchronized block to release the lock temporarily, allowing other
   threads to acquire the lock and perform their tasks.
   - Example usage:
     ```java
     synchronized (sharedObject) {
         while (conditionIsNotMet()) {
             sharedObject.wait(); // Releases the lock and waits
         }
         // Proceed with the task
     }
     ```

2. **join() Method**:
   - The `join()` method is a method defined in the `Thread` class in Java.
   - It is used to wait for a thread to terminate its execution.
   - When a thread calls `join()` on another thread, it waits for that thread to complete before continuing its own execution.
   - This is often used to ensure that a thread completes its task before the main thread or another dependent thread proceeds.
   - Example usage:
     ```java
     Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
         // Task executed by thread1
     });

     Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
         // Task executed by thread2
     });

     thread1.start();
     thread2.start();

     try {
         thread1.join(); // Waits for thread1 to complete
         thread2.join(); // Waits for thread2 to complete
     } catch (InterruptedException e) {
         // Handle interrupted exception
     }
     // Proceed after both threads have completed
     ```

In summary, `wait()` is used for inter-thread communication and synchronization within synchronized blocks,
while `join()` is used to wait for a specific thread to complete its execution before proceeding with other tasks.


join internally used the wait only
